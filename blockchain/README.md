is the core of rust-based blockchains, permeating <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/kp_pmo/" target="_blank">KpPMO</a>, <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/kp_platform/" target="_blank">KpPlatform</a>, <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/kp_mu/" target="_blank">Web3 Technologies</a>. While <b>Rust</b> is not specifically designed for blockchains, the language is extremely convenient to build <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/kp_platform/tree/main/platform" target="_blank">layer-one infrastructure</a>, <a href="https://github.com/khaiphong/kp_pmo/" target="_blank">layer-two data and layer-five applications</a> of blockchains.
